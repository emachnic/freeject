    <h2 id="freeject-background">Freeject Background</h2>
    <p>I started working as an independent developer after being laid off from my first real job. At that point (January 2010), the job was pretty horrible and I doubted I’d be able to find another job quickly so I began freelancing using <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>. I tried many different project management solutions and have not found one that really fit my workflow well. This is my project management solution. It is opinionated and works for me so if it doesn’t fit you then I won’t be upset.</p>
    <h2 id="goals-for-freeject">Goals for Freeject</h2>
    <p>Starting off, this is basically just going to be a Rails app that people can clone and use/modify as they deem fit. Eventually, I’d like to add in mobile apps that are open-sourced as well because the market is seriously lacking in a good, free project management solution with good cross-platform mobile apps.</p>
    <p>Freeject is also starting using a relational database for the backend. I may eventually add the ability to specify other options such as Mongoid or something else.</p>
    <h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
    <p>Check your Ruby version <code>ruby -v</code> and make sure you are on version 1.9.2. You also need to make sure you have Bundler installed <code>(sudo) gem install bundler</code>.</p>
    <p>Start by cloning the application and running migrations</p>
    <pre><code>git clone # Add repository here

    bundle install

    rake db:create

    rake db:migrate
    </code></pre>
    <p>Run the server <code>rails server</code> and navigate to <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a>. You should see a ‘Welcome’ page with instructions for getting started with Freeject. Start playing around and see how everything works.</p>
    <h2 id="freeject-structure">Freeject Structure</h2>
    <p>Starting off you have Dashboard, Projects, Contacts.</p>
    <h3 id="dashboard">Dashboard</h3>
    <p>This is where you start when you login. You’ll see the most immediate Tasks, Projects by due date, and Contact activity/reminders.</p>
    <h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>
    <p>Manage your projects in this section. You can create and manage projects, add user stories to existing projects, and add tasks to user stories.</p>
    <h3 id="contacts">Contacts</h3>
    <p>Freeject implements a basic Contact Management solution. Most CRMs (Customer Relationship Management) software is way too bloated for personal use and focuses on teams interacting with them as opposed to individuals. I just wanted a way to keep track of interactions with contacts and set reminders for them without getting in the way of my personal productivity.</p>
    <h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>
    <p>I’m doing this in my free time so if you like the project and want to help then it is much appreciated. I’m in need of design work right now because I am not and don’t pretend to be a designer.</p>
    <p>You can also contribute by pointing me in the right direction on issues I may have. I will try and keep a list of help issues on here.</p>
    <p>Lastly, if you want to help improve my code then clone the repository and send me a pull request. Please make sure to test things beforehand so the build doesn’t break.</p>
    <h2 id="licensing">Licensing</h2>
